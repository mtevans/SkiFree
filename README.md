# SkiFree
Link to live site can be found [here] (https://mtevans.github.io/SkiFree/). This front end JavaScript game is a remake of the original Ski Free game built using canvas.

## Gameplay
1. As the Skier, your task is to navigate down the ski hill and avoid getting eaten by Sasquatch for as long as possible.
2. The longer you stay alive the more points you getElementById
3. If you have enough point when you eventually come face to face with Sasquatch, you will be able to kill him, otherwise you'll be eaten.
